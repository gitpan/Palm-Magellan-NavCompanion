* Added support for all the record fields I documented.  Oops.

* This is an initial, alpha, developer, not-done-yet release
* I can read the "Companion Waypoints.pdb" file, I just can't write
it yet
* I'm using a Magellan GPS Companion with my Visor Edge.  That's
all I have to test with
* I have to transfer the file from the Palm to my laptop before
I can read it: I can't read it directly from the Palm (wouldn't
that be nice?)
