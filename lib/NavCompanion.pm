=head1 NAME

Palm::Magellan::NavCompanion - access the Magellan GPS Companion waypoints file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Palm::Magellan::NavCompanion;

	my $pdb = Palm::Magellan::NavCompanion->new;
	$pdb->Load( $file );

	my $waypoints = $pdb->{records};

	$, = ", ";
	foreach my $wp ( @$waypoints )
		{
		print $wp->name, $wp->latitude, $wp->longitude;
		print "\n";
		}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module gives you access to the waypoints in the Magellan's GPS
Companion "Companion Waypoints.pdb" file.  You have to be able to load
that file, which probably means that you have it on your computer
rather than your Palm.  On my machine, this file shows up in the Palm
directory as C< Palm/Users/..user../Backups/Companion Waypoints.pdb >.

Behind-the-scenes, Palm::PDB does all the work, so this module has
part of its interface and data structure.  For instance, the Load()
method accesses and parses the file and returns the general data
structure that Palm::PDB creates.  The interesting bits (the
waypoints) is an anonymous array which is the value for the key
C<records>.

	# an anonymous array
	my $waypoints = $pdb->{records};

Each element in C< @{ $waypoints } > is an object of class
C<Palm::Magellan::NavCompanion::Record>, which is really just a class
of accessor methods (for now).

=head2 Methods

=over 4

=item new

Create a new object. This method takes no arguments

=item Load( FILENAME )

Load a file in Palm Database format

=item name

characters.

=item description

The description.  The format allows up to 32
characters.

=item elevation

The altitude, in meters

=item latitude

The latitude, as a decimal number.  Positive numbers are north latitude
and negative numbers are south latitude.

=item longitude

The longitude, as a decimal number.  Positive numbers are east longitude
and negative numbers are west longitude.

=item creation_date

The creation date of the waypoint, in the format MM/DD/YYYY.
This comprises the individual elements found in the database
format, which are also available individually.

=item creation_time

The creation time of the waypoint, in the format HH:MM.ss
This comprises the individual elements found in the database
format, which are also available individually.

=item creation_sec

The second the waypoint was created.

=item creation_min

The minute the waypoint was created.

=item creation_hour

The hour the waypoint was created.

=item creation_day

The day the waypoint was created.

=item creation_mon

The month the waypoint was created.

=item creation_year
